# Pilot for Jumping Sumo

## Prerequisites

It requires the DroneController v0.2.0a

Since it is not available on the net as a binary, 
you have to build and publish it locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/dronocode/drone-controller
cd drone-controller
mvn install
```

## Build and Run

Use sbt to compile and run it.

```
sbt run
```
